Welcome to **Deon Room Folio** — my interactive 3D portfolio website.

This project is a creative digital space designed as a virtual room where visitors can explore my work, personality, and projects in an immersive way. Instead of a traditional scrolling website, the experience allows users to navigate a 3D environment and interact with elements inside the room.

The goal of this project was to build something unique, creative, and memorable — a portfolio that reflects both my technical skills and my imagination.

## 🌟 About the Project

Deon Room Folio is:

- An interactive 3D portfolio experience  
- A virtual room filled with animated and interactive objects  
- A creative way to present my projects and skills  
- A personal experiment in combining design, logic, and interactivity  

Inside the room, users can:

- Explore different sections visually  
- Interact with elements in the scene  
- Discover my projects in a more engaging way  
- Experience small animations that make the space feel alive  

This project was inspired by modern interactive portfolio websites that feel more like games than static pages.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself.

Instead of building a normal portfolio website, I decided to create something that would:

- Push my technical limits  
- Help me understand 3D environments on the web  
- Improve my problem-solving skills  
- Showcase creativity beyond traditional layouts  

This is my first 3D website, so it represents a big learning milestone for me.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Working with 3D Concepts  

I learned how 3D scenes are structured — including cameras, lighting, positioning, and object transformations. Understanding how a virtual space works changed how I think about web design.

### 2️⃣ Managing Interactivity  

Handling user interactions inside a 3D environment is very different from normal web development. I learned how to:

- Detect clicks and pointer movement  
- Trigger animations  
- Control camera movement  
- Create smooth transitions  

### 3️⃣ Problem-Solving & Debugging  

3D projects come with many small unexpected issues:

- Objects not appearing  
- Camera angles behaving strangely  
- Controls not responding correctly  
- Performance optimizations  

Fixing these problems improved my debugging skills and patience.

### 4️⃣ Thinking Creatively  

This project pushed me to think beyond “sections and divs” and instead think in terms of space, motion, and experience.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Interactive 3D room environment  
- Animated objects (fans, chair parts, decorative items, etc.)  
- Immersive user navigation  
- Creative layout instead of traditional scrolling sections

## 🧠 Personal Reflection

This project did not turn out exactly how I originally imagined it — but I’m proud of it.

It represents:

- Growth  
- Curiosity  
- Creativity  
- The courage to try something difficult  

As a student developer, this project marks a major step forward in my journey. It shows that I’m not afraid to experiment, learn, and build beyond my comfort zone.

## 📌 Final Note

Deon Room Folio is more than just a portfolio —  
It’s a learning experience turned into a digital space.

And this is only the beginning.
